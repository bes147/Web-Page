<h1> My Work </h1>
<p> I am currently enrolled in a digital media class at the University of Pittsburgh. Here is one of the assignments that I have composed throughout the semester. I value career paths that allow me to express my creative side while also acting as a professional. Working with children has been the best compromise of these two qualities I possess. </p>
<h2> Visual Argument </h2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bes147/Web-Page/main/Images/Untitled%20design-3.png" alt= "My Visual Argument Piece" width="750" height="450" />
<p> This piece I made to focus on the issue of negative body image that is present in my young adults. Working in a Psychiatric hospital has shown me that the damage low self esteem and bullying can cause on an individual and most of it stems from body image. The red used throughout the image envokes the anger, danger, and stress that is present with eating disorders. The first three letters in the word "diet" are colored red to make the word "die" stand out, showcasing the ultimate danger of negative body image.</p>
