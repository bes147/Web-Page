\f0\fs24 \cf0 I plan on using this webpage to help find a job in the healthcare field. I want to keep the page profession but still upbeat because my dream job would be to work at Children\'92s Hospital of Pittsburgh. I plan on including my visual argument assignment to showcase my graphic design ability while also explaining how my experiences can help my overall patient care. I will include my resume but also further explain my current role at Western Psych since that will directly relate to this new job. I would also like to add a contact page so the employer does not have to go digging around for my information.}
